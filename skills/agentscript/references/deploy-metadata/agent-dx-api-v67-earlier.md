# Define Agent Metadata (v67 and Earlier)

Create a manifest to define the metadata you want to retrieve. You can copy and edit the default manifest that was created in your project at `manifest/package.xml`.

## Understand Agent and Legacy Agent Metadata

- Draft (uncommitted) agents and agent versions are represented by `AiAuthoringBundle`, **not** `Bot` or `BotVersion`. You **can** edit a draft agent.
- Committed agents and agent versions are represented by `AiAuthoringBundle`, plus `Bot` and `BotVersion`. You **can't** edit a committed agent. Instead, create and edit a new version.
- Legacy agents don't have a commit stage, and are represented by `Bot` and `BotVersion` (not `AiAuthoringBundle`). You can edit and overwrite an active legacy agent.

| Agent Type      | Metadata Representation                  | Editable |
| :-------------- | :--------------------------------------- | :------- |
| Draft Agent     | `AiAuthoringBundle`                      | Yes      |
| Committed Agent | `AiAuthoringBundle`, `Bot`, `BotVersion` | No       |
| Legacy Agent    | `Bot` and `BotVersion`                   | Inactive versions are editable, active versions are not      |

## Example package.xml Manifest Files

Use these examples to get started:

- Replace the version number (for example, `<version>65.0</version>`) with your required metadata version. Your project's sample `package.xml` manifest contains the most recent version number.
- Add any other metadata types that your agent needs, such as Data 360 dependencies.

| [Manifest Defining All Agents (v67 and Earlier)](./package-allagents67.md)                                | Defines metadata for all agents, including legacy agents. Includes metadata for all flows, prompt templates, and Apex classes in the org. | Replace the `*` wildcard with the API names of the ApexClass, Flows, and GenAiPromptTemplates that your agents use. Using wildcards for these types can pull excessive data, leading to very long deployments or timeouts.                                          |
| [Manifest Defining a Single Agent Version (v67 and Earlier)](./package-singleagent67.md)                  | Defines a single version of an agent, plus the flows, prompt templates, and Apex class types that the agent version uses.                 | Before deploying a single agent version into an org (using `BotVersion`), you must have deployed the full agent to the org. Deploying the agent before deploying a specific version ensures that all required metadata and artifacts are created in the target org. |
| [Manifest for Different Bot/AiAuthoringBundle Versions (v67 and Earlier)](./package-single-mismatch67.md) | Defines a single agent version when the `AiAuthoringBundle` version doesn't match the `Bot`/`BotVersion` version.                         | This difference can happen when you save more versions than you commit.

### Update Your Manifest

To define a single agent version, make these changes to your manifest.

1. Instead of `Bot`, which is the top-level representation of an agent, use `BotVersion`, which represents the configuration for a specific agent version. Include the agent version's name and version number. For example:

```sfdocs-code {"lang":"xml", "title": "Specify a BotVersion in the Manifest"}
<types>
   <members>NGA_Service_Agent.v2</members>
   <name>BotVersion</name>
</types>
```

2. Instead of using the agent's name to specify `AiAuthoringBundle` and `GenAiPlannerBundle`, use the agent's versioned name. For example:

```sfdocs-code {"lang":"xml", "title": "Reference an Agent Version by Its Versioned Name"}
<types>
   <members>NGA_Service_Agent_2</members>
   <name>AiAuthoringBundle</name>
<types>
   <members>AgentforceServiceAgent_v2</members>
   <name>GenAiPlannerBundle</name>
</types>
</types>
```

(Optional) - Update Your Manifest for Different Bot/AiAuthoringBundle Versions

Use these steps to specify the correct versions for your agent's metadata.

## (Optional) - Update Your Manifest for Different Bot/AiAuthoringBundle Versions

Use these steps to specify the correct versions for your agent’s metadata.

### What are mismatched `Bot`/`AiAuthoringBundle` versions?

When you save an agent version, Agentforce creates `AiAuthoringBundle` metadata. When you commit an agent version, Agentforce creates Bot/BotVersion metadata. If you save more versions than you commit, the version of your `AiAuthoringBundle` won't match the version of your Bot/BotVersion.

For example, this agent has 11 versions of an agent and 7 committed versions. Therefore, the agent's metadata contains 11 versions of `AiAuthoringBundle` and 7 versions of `Bot` and `BotVersion`. You'll need to specify the correct version numbers to match the correct `AiAuthoringBundle` to the correct `Bot` and `BotVersion`.

> *[Image removed — see online documentation]*

To find the matching `Bot` version, open the AiAuthoringBundle folder for your desired version. In the agent version's `bundle-meta.xml` file, the `target` metadata shows the version to use for the `GenAiPlannerBundle` and `BotVersion`.

For example, version 9 of the agent "TestAgentFromSource" uses version 7 of `GenAiPlannerBundle` and `BotVersion`.

Use these versions to specify your manifest, for example [Manifest for Different Bot/AiAuthoringBundle Versions (v67 and Earlier)](./package-single-mismatch67.md)
